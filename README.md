```

## Dependencies
The Flow-maker project relies on the following dependencies:

- Neo4j database: The project utilizes the Neo4j graph database to store and manage job flow data.

- NestJS: Flow-maker is built using the NestJS framework, which provides a solid foundation for creating scalable and maintainable Node.js applications.

- GraphQL: Flow-maker provides a GraphQL-based interface for interacting with the project and managing job flows.

## Usage
Once the project is up and running, you can use the GraphQL interface to register jobs and create job flows. The interface allows you to define the connections between jobs and specify the flow of execution.

By leveraging the power of GraphQL, you can easily query and manipulate the job flows according to your requirements.
